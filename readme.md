A Wrapper for https://pybricks.com/ev3-micropython to control via [OSC](https://opensoundcontrol.stanford.edu/)
- needs WLAN

uses modified https://github.com/SpotlightKid/micropython-osc 

### Starten
Damit das Neueste Program auf dem Lego Roboter installiert wird muss zunächst sich via dem vscode Plugin mit dem Roboter verbunden werden.
Sobald dies geschehen ist kann damit der Code auf den Roboter heruntergeladen wird die "Download und Run" Funktion aus der `.vscode/launch.json` benutzt werden.


Damit der Code nicht erneut heruntergeladen werden muss kann das Program auf zwei weisen gestartet werden:
* Auf dem Lego Roboter selbst im Dateibrowser die main.py starten.
* Über ein SSH-Terminal folgendes Kommando eingeben: `brickrun --directory="/home/robot/legoOSC" "/home/robot/legoOSC/main.py"`




## How to use
1. import this as a Lego-Micropython Projekt (https://pybricks.com/ev3-micropython/startrun.html)
2. run it on the EV3-Brick
3. use the Routes to control the Brick

### UDP
- default incomming port: 9001
- listens on own IP and local BROADCAST


- Default outgoing target port: 9001
- default taget is local BROADCAST 

### TCP
- Default-Port: 9002
- listens on own IP for connections
- only on connection at the time
- when connected:
  - expects valid OSC + `\n` as last byte -> **must not use any argument with a `\n` inside**
  - sends valid OSC + `\n` as last byte

# Routes:

## Placeholder
Placeholders can be:
- `ID` for `IP-Address` or `Name`  
- `PORT` for `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `s1`, `s2`, `s3` or `s4` 
- `PORTs` for a `PORTS` or a group of `PORT`, e.g. `a`, `ab`, `bcd`  
- `MOTOR_ACTION` for `coast`, `hold` or `brake`

## Debugging
On any error the OSCBrick should send `/ID/error [Errormessage as string]`  
- `/ID/error/test`  
  replies with a dummy-error
Received OSC can be logged with 
- `/ID/log [boolean]`   
  on `true` will mirror all the received OSC-Messages back as `/ID/log/received [message as string]`  
  disable with `false`


## Identification  
- `/oscbrick/identify` replies with `/NAME [IP as string]`
